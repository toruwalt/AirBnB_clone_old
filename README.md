#AirBnB Clone Project - The Console

This is the first step towards building our first full web application in the ALX_SE programme: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because we will use what we build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…


Task handled include:


-Making a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances

-Creating a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file

-Creating all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel

-Creating the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.


-Creating all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine.
