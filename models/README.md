# Models

## Purpose:

This folder houses the fundamental building blocks of your application: the BaseModel class and the engine for persistent data storage. These components define the structure and interactions for your application's models.

## Contents:

**BaseModel:** This file defines the BaseModel class, serving as the foundation for all your application's data models. It provides essential functionality like:
-Automatic field creation: Generate fields based on class variables for flexibility.
-Serialization/deserialization: Convert model objects to and from file storage formats (e.g., **JSON**) seamlessly.
-Timestamp management: Keep track of creation and modification times for auditing purposes.
-Custom validation: Ensure data integrity using tailored validation rules.
-Database interactions (if applicable): Handle model persistence using an appropriate database adapter.

**Engine** This file implements the engine class, responsible for interacting with the underlying file storage mechanism. It likely manages operations like:
Saving/loading model objects to the chosen storage medium (e.g., file, database).

**CRUD** (create, read, update, delete) operations on stored models.
Caching (if implemented): Optimize performance by storing frequently accessed data in memory.
Connection management: Handle connections to the storage medium efficiently.

**Usage:**
Derive new models from BaseModel to represent your application's entities, specifying appropriate fields and validation rules.
Interact with models through their instances, using methods like save(), update(), and delete().
Refer to the specific implementation details in BaseModel.py and engine.py for customizations or advanced usages.
